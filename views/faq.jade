                h2(class="faqTitle medium", id="clothesQuestion")   What should I wear?
                p(class="faqAnswer")
                    | Attire is seasonal semiformal.  Feel free to wear colorful, festive clothing,
                    | bearing in mind the <a href="#weatherQuestion">weather considerations</a>.

                h2(class="faqTitle medium", id="weatherQuestion")   What will the weather be like?
                p(class="faqAnswer")
                    | First of all, we are hoping to have the wedding outside, but the weather
                    | at that time of year is not easy to predict.  We have both an outside
                    | an inside option available, and we will make the final decision based
                    | on the weather the day of the ceremony.  That being said, it could
                    | be t-shirt weather or it could be snowing. The average daytime
                    | temperature in November is 56 with a low of 34, but the average
                    | in October is 69.  Since we're so close to October, 61-62 is probably
                    | a more reasonable guess.
