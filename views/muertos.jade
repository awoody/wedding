                | Dia de los Muertos is a traditional holiday when families come together
                | to remember their deceased ancestors.  It coincides with All Saints Day
                | and All Souls Day, and has a similar, albeit much more colorful, focus.

                    | Amongst the many traditions that go hand in hand with Dia de los Muertos, there are a few that
                    | particularly stand out.  For one thing, bright colors, particularly purple, red, orange, white
                    | and pink often make appearences, as in the image on the left. <br /> <br />
                    | Another prominent theme of Dia de los Muertos is Skeletons, and they can be found in almost every
                    | image on website on the subject. <br /> <br />
                    | Both Andrea and Alex are fascinated with Dia de los Muertos (Andrea even has a sugar skull tattoo!),
                    | and they are very excited to have their wedding coincide with the holiday.

                | Around Albuquerque, there are quite a few interesting events that take place for Dia de Los Muertos,
                | and one of them is the day after our wedding! It's called the marigold parade and more information
                | can be found
                a(href="http://muertosymarigolds.org/") here.

                        | In Mexico, it is traditional to keep altars for deceased family members.  On November 1st and 2nd, these altars explode with
                        | color when they are decorated with marigolds and other bright flowers.  During the feast, an 'Ofrenda' (offering) is made
                        | to the ancestors.  On the 1st, the day traditionally associated with deceased children, altars are filled with things like
                        | toys, candies and chocolates.  One the 2nd, the day traditionally associated with adults, alatars tend to take on a more
                        | adult character: they are filled with tequila, cigarettes, soda, tortillas, and other things the person may have been fond of
                        | in life.

                    | In addition to the bright flowers and various items, altars are often adorned with Calaveras de Azucar (Sugar Skulls).  These
                    | are molded skulls that are made completely out of sugar and can be eaten as a treat.  We plan to fully include many
                    | traditional decorations in our wedding, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papel_picado" target="#">Papel Picado</a>, Sugar skulls and marigolds.

                    | While it may seem morbid, the Day of the Dead feast is actually a celebration of life, and a moment when those who have
                    | gone before us are honored and are briefly present, if only in spirit, in our lives.  We hope to include our ancestors in
                    | our wedding by having our families bring wedding photos of our deceased loved ones, including our grandparents, great
                    | grandparents, and beyond.
