                | Dia de los Muertos is a traditional holiday when families come together
                | to remember their deceased ancestors.  It coincides with All Saints Day
                | and All Souls Day, and has a similar, albeit much more colorful, focus.

                    | Amongst the many traditions that go hand in hand with Dia de los Muertos, there are a few that
                    | particularly stand out.  For one thing, bright colors, particularly purple, red, orange, white
                    | and pink often make appearences, as in the image on the left. <br /> <br />
                    | Another prominent theme of Dia de los Muertos is Skeletons, and they can be found in almost every
                    | image on website on the subject. <br /> <br />
                    | Both Andrea and Alex are fascinated with Dia de los Muertos (Andrea even has a sugar skull tattoo!),
                    | and they are very excited to have their wedding coincide with the holiday.
